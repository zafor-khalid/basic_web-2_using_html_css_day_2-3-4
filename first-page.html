            <p> <strong><span style="font-size:xx-large; color: rgb(10, 7, 53);">T</span>echnology</strong> has also increased the productivity of almost every industry in the world. Thanks to
                technology, we can even pay with bitcoins instead of using banks. The digital coin has been such a game
                changing factor, that many realised that this is the right time to open a bitcoin demo account.

                When observed more closely, new things are discovered every day. Let’s take for instance when radio
                waves were discovered, radio broadcasts followed suit almost immediately. The same applies to the
                television and electricity. If no one had discovered that electricity could be generated, then the
                entertainment industry wouldn’t be at it’s current stage of development.

                Technology improves daily lives; allowing to move physical storage units to virtual storage banks and
                more. Scientists of the time are also able to send astronauts to the moon thanks to technology.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages, for example, dependence on new
                technology. Man no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer
                makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory. The decline of human capital implies an
                increase in unemployment. In some areas, devices can replace the human mind.</p>

                <summary>2021: The Year of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence</summary>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;text-align: justify;">One of the big things that happened late in 2020 was
                    that
                    the FAA cleared the way for drone delivery,
                    allowing drones to fly over populated areas and at night. Initially, drone delivery will mostly
                    deploy
                    in rural areas where it makes sense given the lack of high-density housing such apartment complexes
                    that
                    don't lend themselves to drone delivery. Still, for some of us, drones delivering packages will be
                    common by the end of this year. For folks in New York and Las Vegas, Walmart will be delivering by
                    air
                    to you shortly.</p>

                <summary>New FAA Rules Clear Delivery Drones for Takeoff</summary>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;text-align: justify;">Final rules governing unmanned aircraft, commonly
                    known as
                    drones, were released Monday by the Federal Aviation Administration, a move expected to open the
                    door
                    for delivery of consumer packages by air.

                    The rules establish minimum standards for safety so drones can fly over populated areas and at
                    night,
                    under certain conditions.</p>
